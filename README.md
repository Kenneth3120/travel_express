You are a professional Full stack app developer. You develop cool apps with very good UI/UX. So lets start with the problem statement:

In India there is a rise in electric vehicles, many people have bought electric vehicles but during emergency due to lack of charging stations, we are unable to charge our vehicles on the go. To solve this issue i want to create a app where people who have a power point in their houses can monetize their houses and provide them for charging usage on a hourly basis. Its would be just like airbnb for electric vehicles. There will be three users. Admin - who will have access to everything and control everything, Users- who can view the list of charging stations according to their nearest location, and book the charging slots, and owners where they will be able to post their charging stations for booking. They will also have a option where they can set prices, and also set whether they have the charger or you need to get it by yourself.
